<q>“A promise is a gift and a gift is a symbol of a social relationship. The donor is aware that it creates a link and the recipient identifies it as a mutual bond. A gift, however, is tangible and a promise is not.<hr> Eventually, a promise can be expounded as misunderstood, or misheard or it is simply over and done.</hr>  </q>
